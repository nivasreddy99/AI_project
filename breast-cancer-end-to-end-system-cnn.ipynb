of 9,109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients.\n","- The images are collected using different magnifying factors (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X). \n","- To date, it contains 2,480 benign and 5,429 malignant samples (700X460 pixels, 3-channel RGB, 8-bit depth in each channel, PNG format).\n","- This database has been built in collaboration with the P&D Laboratory â€“ Pathological Anatomy and Cytopathology, Parana, Brazil (http://www.prevencaoediagnose.com.br). \n","- Each image filename stores information about the image itself: method of procedure biopsy, tumor class, tumor type, patient identification, and magnification factor. \n","- For example, SOBBTA-14-4659-40-001.png is the image 1, at magnification factor 40X, of a benign tumor of type tubular
